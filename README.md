Driver Drowsiness Detection with Real-Time Alert System

This project addresses the critical issue of road accidents caused by driver fatigue. It introduces a real-time monitoring system that continuously analyzes a live video feed to detect signs of drowsiness by focusing on facial and eye movements. Once drowsiness is identified, the system triggers instant alerts to help prevent potential accidents. Designed for high accuracy and efficiency, the solution operates smoothly at over 20 FPS and is optimized for low-resource deployment. It offers a proactive approach to enhancing road safety, especially in commercial and long-distance transportation contexts. Future improvements include expanding detection capabilities and integrating with vehicle systems for broader safety applications.
